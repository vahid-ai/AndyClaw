# AndyClaw

An open-source AI assistant for Android that can control your device, manage crypto wallets, run Linux commands, and operate autonomously in the background. Built by [Freedom Factory](https://github.com/EthereumPhone) for the [dGEN1](https://dgen.gg) and ethOS, but runs on any Android device.

## How It Works

AndyClaw is a single APK that operates in two modes depending on what device it's running on:

### On ethOS (dGEN1)

When installed on a device running ethOS, AndyClaw automatically detects the OS wallet service and unlocks **privileged mode**. No API key needed. authentication is handled by signing a message with your ethOS wallet.

**What you get in privileged mode on top of all other features:**

- Wallet integration (send transactions, check balances, manage tokens across Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and more)
- XMTP messaging (send and receive onchain messages)
- Full device control (WiFi, Bluetooth, mobile data, audio, power)
- Phone calls and call management
- Calendar read/write
- Full App management (install, uninstall, clear data, force stop)
- Device power controls (reboot, shutdown)
- Code execution
- Screen time and usage stats
- OS-managed heartbeat (the OS triggers the AI periodically, no foreground service needed)
- An autonomous sub-account wallet the AI controls for micro-payments and DeFi

### On Stock Android

When installed on a regular Android device, AndyClaw runs in **open mode**. You can use the integrated local model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) or bring your own API key (currently [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) or [tinfoil.sh](https://tinfoil.sh/inference)).

**What you get in open mode:**

- Chat with the AI assistant
- Device info (battery, storage, device details)
- Clipboard read/write
- Contacts read/write
- Install apps via Aurora Store (no google play required)
- SMS send/read
- Camera capture
- Location and navigation
- App listing and launching
- Notification reading
- File system operations
- Shell commands
- Web search
- Long-term memory (the AI remembers things across sessions)
- Background heartbeat via foreground service
- Termux integration (if Termux is installed)
- ClawHub skills (install community-made skills)

**Setup:**

1. Install the APK
2. On first launch, select your mode (local Qwen2.5-1.5B model) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) or [tinfoil.sh](https://tinfoil.sh/inference) api key
3. Tell the AI what you want help with
4. Name your AI (or keep the default)
5. Share your values/priorities
6. Choose which skills to enable (or turn on YOLO mode for full access)

## Features

### AI Agent Loop

AndyClaw uses an agentic tool-use loop. The AI can chain multiple tool calls together to accomplish complex tasks — checking your battery, looking up a contact, sending them a message, and logging what it did, all in a single conversation turn. Up to 20 tool iterations per request.

### Heartbeat

The heartbeat is the AI's autonomous background pulse. It wakes up periodically (default: 30 minutes, configurable) and can:

- Check device status (battery, connectivity, storage)
- Review notifications and messages
- Execute pending tasks
- Log what it found and did

On ethOS, the OS triggers the heartbeat directly. On stock Android, a foreground service keeps it alive.

Heartbeat logs are viewable in-app so you can see exactly what the AI did while you weren't looking.

### Skills System

Skills are modular capabilities the AI can use. There are 30+ built-in skills covering everything from device info or  installing apps to even crypto wallets. Skills are system-aware. Some are available on all Android devices, others require ethOS privileged access.

**ClawHub** lets you install and manage community-created skills written as SKILL.md files. These can be instruction-only (the AI follows written procedures) or Termux-executable (the AI runs scripts in a Linux environment).

### Shizuku Integration

[Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) bridges the gap between a normal app and a system app on stock Android. When Shizuku is installed and activated, AndyClaw gains ADB-level permissions without requiring root, unlocking capabilities that were previously only available on ethOS:

- **App management** — silent install/uninstall, force stop, clear app data
- **System settings** — write to `Settings.Secure` and `Settings.Global` (e.g., change default DNS, toggle features)
- **Permission control** — grant/revoke runtime permissions for any app, including AndyClaw itself
- **Device control** — reboot, toggle WiFi/Bluetooth/mobile data, change screen brightness and timeout
- **Elevated shell** — run any command as the `shell` user (uid 2000), same as ADB. Access `dumpsys`, `logcat`, `am`, `pm`, `settings`, `input`, `wm`, `svc` and more
- **Input simulation** — simulate taps, swipes, and text input via `input` commands

**Setup:** Install the [Shizuku app](https://shizuku.rikka.app/), activate it via wireless debugging (Android 11+) or ADB, then enable the Shizuku skill in AndyClaw settings. The agent will automatically detect Shizuku availability and request permission when needed.

### Termux Integration

If [Termux](https://termux.dev) is installed, the AI gets a full Linux environment. It can run bash commands, install packages, execute scripts, and interact with the terminal. ClawHub skills can define Termux entrypoints that get synced and executed automatically.

See the **[Termux Setup Guide](guides/termux-setup.md)** for step-by-step installation and configuration instructions for stock android devices.

### Long-Term Memory

The AI has a semantic memory system backed by SQLite FTS4 and vector embeddings. It can store and retrieve memories across sessions. Be it facts you tell it, things it learns or context from conversations. Memories are automatically injected into the system prompt when relevant.

### Sessions

Chat history is persisted. You can resume previous conversations or start fresh ones.

### Extensions

Third-party apps can register as AndyClaw extensions, providing additional functions that get discovered and loaded automatically. Any Android app can become an extension by declaring metadata in its manifest and exposing an IPC bridge — a bound service, content provider, broadcast receiver, or activity intent. AndyClaw scans all installed packages, picks up extensions, and makes their functions available to the agent.

See the **[Extension Development Guide](ExtensionExample/README.md)** for a full walkthrough of the architecture, wire protocol, and step-by-step instructions for building your own extension. The `ExtensionExample/` module is a minimal working reference implementation.

## Requirements

- Android 15+ (API 35)
- (Optinal) AI api keys:
  - OpenRouter  (stock Android only — get one at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai))
  - Tinfoil  (stock Android only — get one at [tinfoil.sh](https://tinfoil.sh/inference))
- Optional: [Termux](https://termux.dev) for Linux command execution
- Optional: [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) for ADB-level device control without root

## Models

AndyClaw routes through either [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), [tinfoil.sh](https://tinfoil.sh/inference)(stock android) or the integrated gateway (ethOS). The default model is `minimax/minimax-m2.5`. You can switch models in settings.

## Building From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EthereumPhone/AndyClaw.git
cd AndyClaw
```

Create `local.properties` if it doesn't exist and add any optional keys:

```properties
# Optional — only needed for wallet/crypto features, especially if running on ethOS
BUNDLER_API=your_pimlico_bundler_key
ALCHEMY_API=your_alchemy_api_key

# Optional — override the premium LLM gateway URL
PREMIUM_LLM_URL=https://your-gateway.com/api/llm

# Optional — build as system app (for ethOS system image builds)
SYSTEM_APP=true
```

Build the APK:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.

## Permissions

AndyClaw requests a wide range of permissions to support its full skill set. On stock Android, most privileged permissions (device power, package management, system settings) are not usable without either ethOS or [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/). With Shizuku activated, the agent can use ADB-level permissions to manage apps, write system settings, control device power, and more. Standard permissions (contacts, SMS, camera, location, etc.) are requested at runtime when a skill needs them.
